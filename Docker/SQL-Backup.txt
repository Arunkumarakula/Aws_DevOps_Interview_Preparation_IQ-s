MySQL (Docker) Backup

we had a MySQL database running inside a Docker container named redeemx_db.
my goal is to create a database backup and get that backup file onto the host machine.


list all running Docker containers
    - docker ps 

Exec into the container
   - docker exec -it redeemx_db /bin/bash

Create db dump file 
   - mysqldump -u root -p redeemx_db > sqldmp.sql

   - This command exported the entire database db and saved it inside the container as a file named sqldmp.sql
   - Now we can see the sqldmp.sql in the container which consists of db data

copy the backup from container to host
    - docker cp redeemx_db:sqldmp.sql .

    - copy the db file which is in the container from the host not from the container.

Check the backup file in the currect path /home/ubuntu

again logininto the DB container using exec

execute all the SQL statements inside the file update_emp_ids.sql on the database redeemx_db
    - mysql -u root -p redeemx_db < update_emp_ids.sql

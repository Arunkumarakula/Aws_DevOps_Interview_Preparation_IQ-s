 1. Explain your Day to Day activities?
    - In my day-to-day activities as a DevOps Engineer, I focus on maintaining and improving the CI/CD pipeline to ensure smooth and automated code
      delivery.
    - I start my day by checking the status of overnight builds and deployments in Jenkins and reviewing logs, resolving any failed jobs, and ensuring the
      latest code is successfully deployed to the test or staging environments.
    - I also collaborated with developers to integrate new services or features, update Docker images, and manage Kubernetes deployments. I frequently use
      tools like Terraform or Ansible to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
    - Monitoring is another key part of my role. I check dashboards in tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch to ensure system health, performance,
      and uptime. If there are alerts or incidents, I investigate root causes and implement preventive measures.
    - Apart from that, I spend time improving automation scripts, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and participating in sprint meetings to plan upcoming releases
      or infrastructure changes.
    - Overall, my day revolves around ensuring the system is stable, scalable, and deployments are seamless.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Do you have hands-on in Linux? If yes, Which Platform?
   - Yes, I have strong hands-on experience working with Linux systems.
   - I’ve primarily worked on Ubuntu and Amazon Linux environments for application hosting and deployment, and I’ve also used ubuntu for on-premise servers.
   - My daily work involves managing servers, configuring users and permissions, handling file systems, setting up cron jobs, analyzing logs under /var/log,
     and managing network configurations.
   - I also use Linux extensively for automation and scripting to automate deployment steps, cleanup tasks, and monitoring checks.
   - Additionally, I work with Linux inside Docker containers and manage Linux-based EC2 instances in AWS. Overall, I’m very comfortable with Linux command-
     line operations and system administration tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What is the latest version of Ubuntu?
   - As of now, the latest Ubuntu release is Ubuntu 25.10, codenamed ‘Questing Quokka’, which was released in October 2025.
   - However in production environments. we often prefer using the LTS (Long-Term Support) versions for stability. the latest LTS release is Ubuntu 24.04
     LTS
     (Noble Numbat), supported until April 2029.
   - So while 25.10 is the newest version, most enterprises still rely on 24.04 LTS for long-term deployments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. I have an index.html file in GitHub. I need to deploy it on AWS with one load balancer. I’m given the GitHub username and token. How can I achieve this?
   - To deploy the index.html from GitHub to AWS with a load balancer, I’d first create two EC2 instances and install a web server like Apache or Nginx.
   - Then, I’d configure an AWS Application Load Balancer and attach both EC2 instances to it for high availability.
   - Next, I’d set up an automated deployment pipeline. I could use AWS CodePipeline integrated with GitHub using the provided username and token, so
     whenever code is pushed to the main branch, the pipeline automatically pulls the latest index.html and deploys it to the EC2 servers.
   - Alternatively, I could use Jenkins for CI/CD. configure GitHub as the source, and use SSH or SCP to deploy the file to the web servers.
   - Finally, I’d verify the deployment by accessing the Load Balancer’s DNS name in the browser to ensure the page is being served correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. what is dependinces resources for the IP?
   - In AWS, several resources depend on IP addresses. mainly EC2 instances, Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs), Load Balancers, and NAT Gateways.
   - Each EC2 instance gets a private IP, and an Public or Elastic IP can be attached for public access (optionally). Network Load Balancers also require
     Elastic IPs if we want static IPs. NAT Gateways and VPN Gateways depend on public IPs for internet routing.
   - Other components like Route 53, Security Groups, and DNS records indirectly depend on IPs for routing and access control.
   - That’s why in DevOps we generally manage these dependencies through Infrastructure as Code, so when an IP or resource changes dependent resources
     automatically update without manual intervention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What is the command to connect EC2 instance?
  - To connect to an EC2 instance, I use SSH with the private key provided by AWS.
    The basic command is: ssh -i <keypair>.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
  - The username depends on the AMI type. for example, ‘ec2-user’ for Amazon Linux and ‘ubuntu’ for Ubuntu.
  - Before connecting, I make sure the key file has proper permissions using chmod 400, and that port 22 is open in the instance’s security group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How to implement Internet gateway?
   - To enable internet access, I create an Internet Gateway, attach it to the VPC, and make the public subnet’s route table point 0.0.0.0/0 to the IGW. I
     ensure instances in that subnet have public or Elastic IPs, and I open the right security-group (and NACL) rules. Without the default route, public IP,
     and SG/NACL allows, the IGW alone won’t provide connectivity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. How to configure internet gateway to route table?
 
 - Step 1: Create an Internet Gateway

    * Go to VPC → Internet Gateways → Create Internet Gateway
    * Give it a name (e.g., my-igw)
    * Click Attach to VPC and select your VPC (e.g., vpc-1234abcd)


 - Step 2: Add Route to the Route Table
 
   * Go to VPC → Route Tables
   * Select the Route Table associated with your public subnet
   * Under Routes, click Edit routes → Add route
     Add this entry: Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
   * Target: your Internet Gateway (e.g., igw-1234abcd)


 - Step 3: Associate Route Table with the Subnet

   * In the same Route Table, go to the Subnet associations tab.
   * Click Edit subnet associations
   * Select your public subnet


 - Step 4: Verify Security

   Make sure: The instance has a public IP or Elastic IP
              - The security group allows outbound traffic (and inbound if needed)
              - The NACL allows inbound/outbound ephemeral ports

* To configure an Internet Gateway with a route table, first I create and attach the IGW to the VPC.
  Then, I go to the route table associated with my public subnet and add a route with destination 0.0.0.0/0, targeting the Internet Gateway.
  This ensures that any traffic going to the internet is routed through the IGW.
  I also make sure the subnet is associated with that route table and that the EC2 instances have public IPs and proper security group rules.
  Without the route and subnet association, the IGW won’t provide internet access.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. What is the exact command to log in to an EC2 instance, and what kind of authentication will you use? Do you need to provide a password or something
   else?
  - AWS uses public-private key pair authentication instead of passwords for better security.
  - The public key is stored in the instance (~/.ssh/authorized_keys), and I authenticate using the private .pem key on my local machine.
  - Therefore, I don’t need to enter any password. I also ensure the key file has the right permissions using chmod 400 before connecting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. In which path will you create index.html in Server ?
    - When we need to  deploy a static website like index.html on a Linux web server. the location depends on which web server we are using mostly Apache
      (httpd) or Nginx.
    - The index.html file should be placed inside the web server’s document root directory.
    - For Apache, the default path is /var/www/html/, and for Nginx, it’s usually /usr/share/nginx/html/.

    So I will create or copy the file there for example:
    - sudo cp index.html /var/www/html/
    - Then restart the web service using sudo systemctl restart httpd or nginx.
    - After that, the file will be accessible via the instance’s public IP or domain name.

11. Explain Most common linux Commands

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. How to check one running process?
    - A process is any running program in Linux. for example, Apache (httpd), Nginx, Jenkins, or a script we started. To check a running process, we can use
      several commands, depending on what we need:
        * To list all processes
        * To find a specific process
        * To see detailed info (PID, memory, CPU, etc.)
        * To monitor it in real time

ps -ef                     # Shows all running processes in full detail
ps -ef | grep nginx        # Finds a specific process (e.g., nginx)
pgrep nginx                # Displays process ID(s) for nginx
top                        # Live view of running processes (CPU, memory usage)
htop                       # Interactive version of top (easier to read/manage)
sudo systemctl status nginx # Checks if a service like nginx is active or stopped
pidof nginx                # Shows the PID of a running service
kill <PID>                 # Gracefully stops a process by its PID
kill -9 <PID>              # Forcefully kills a process (use with caution)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13.  How to list running process?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. You need to find one particular process id and how to kill that? Is it possible in single command?
    - kill <process-name> eg: kill nginx

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15. How to check disk usage?
    - df -h           # Check total disk usage (human-readable)
    - du -sh /path    # Check size of a specific directory
    - du -sh *        # Show size of all files/directories in current path
    - df -i           # Check inode usage

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. How to find free memory?
    - To check free memory in Linux. I use the free -h command it shows total, used, and available memory in a readable format.
    - I can also use top or htop for real-time monitoring, and cat /proc/meminfo to view detailed memory stats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17. How do you archive and compress directory in Linux?
    - I use tar -czvf to create a compressed archive and tar -xzvf to extract it.

    eg: to Create, tar -czvf archive-name.tar.gz /path/to/directory
        to extract, tar -xzvf archive-name.tar.gz

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18. Chmod 755 means?
    - chmod 755 sets the file permissions so that the owner has full access (read, write, execute), and the group and others have read and execute
      permissions only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19. If I provide chmod 755 means, what exactly will happen?
    - When I run chmod 755 <file>, it changes the file’s permissions so the owner can read, write, and execute it, while the group and others can only read
      and execute it.
    - In other words, it makes the file executable by everyone, but only the owner can modify it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20. what is chown ?
    - chown stands for change owner. it’s used to change the ownership of a file or directory in Linux.

    The basic syntax is: chown <owner>:<group> <file>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21. How to list all ssh users in Linux?
    - To list all SSH users in Linux, I first check which users have shell access, since only those can log in through SSH.

    * I use the command: grep '/bin/bash' /etc/passwd (This lists all users who have an interactive shell and are therefore allowed to log in via SSH.)
 
    - To see users who are currently connected through SSH, I can use: who or w

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22. If one apache server is running, I need to check logs? where do I check? In which directory?
    - When an Apache web server is running, its log files are stored in the /var/log/httpd/ or /var/log/apache2/ directory depending on the Linux
      distribution.
      For example:

      * On Red Hat / CentOS / Amazon Linux, Apache logs are in: /var/log/httpd/

      * On Ubuntu / Debian, Apache logs are in: /var/log/apache2/

    - Inside these directories, there are typically two main log files:

      * access_log (or access.log) → records all incoming requests

      * error_log (or error.log) → records errors and issues

    - These logs are crucial for troubleshooting HTTP errors, debugging deployments, and monitoring traffic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23. what kind of logs can see in /var/log ?
    - The /var/log directory in Linux contains all major system and application logs.
    - It’s where the operating system, services, and applications write their log files for monitoring and troubleshooting.

    Some common logs you can see there are:

   * /var/log/messages → General system messages, boot logs, and errors (on RHEL/CentOS)

   * /var/log/syslog → System and service logs (on Ubuntu/Debian)

   * /var/log/secure → Authentication and security-related logs (SSH, sudo, etc.)

   * /var/log/auth.log → Same as above on Ubuntu/Debian

   * /var/log/dmesg → Kernel and hardware-related messages

   * /var/log/cron → Cron job execution logs

   * /var/log/maillog → Mail server logs

   * /var/log/httpd/ or /var/log/apache2/ → Apache web server logs

   * /var/log/nginx/ → Nginx web server logs

   * /var/log/boot.log → Boot process information

   * /var/log/yum.log → Package installation history (on RHEL-based systems)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24. The what is the purpose of grep command?
    - grep command in Linux is used to search for specific text or patterns inside files or command outputs. It stands for Global Regular Expression Print.

     For example: grep "error" /var/log/syslog (This searches for the word ‘error’ inside the syslog file and prints all matching lines)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25. I need to grep the keyword ‘hello’. Except for the keyword ‘hello’, I want to list out all the lines from the file linux.txt. Which flag will you use
    with grep?
   - To display all the lines except the ones containing the keyword ‘hello’, I’ll use the -v flag with the grep command.

    The command is: grep -v "hello" linux.txt

   - The -v option is used to invert the match, meaning it will show all lines that do not contain the word ‘hello’.
   - So, this command will print every line from linux.txt except those containing the word ‘hello’.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26. Difference between "cron" and "at" ?
    - Both cron and at are used to schedule tasks in Linux, but they serve different purposes.

    * cron is used for recurring or periodic tasks for example, running a backup script every day at midnight.
    * at is used for a one-time task for example, running a script at a specific time only once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27. How to schedule activity in Linux and you need to run a script every 5 minutes?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28. Explain Git pull and Git Fetch?
    - Both git fetch and git pull are used to update our local repository from the remote, but they work differently.

    * git fetch only downloads the latest changes from the remote repository into local repo. it doesn’t change or merge your working branch.
    * git pull does both it first performs a git fetch and then automatically merges those changes into your current branch.

Issues with Nginx:

The issue happened because NGINX was not configured correctly for a Single Page Application.
Routes like /dashboard don’t exist as real files, but NGINX tried to load them as files and returned 404 instead of serving index.html.
This happened due to multiple conflicting location / blocks. After fixing the routing and adding the proper try_files rule, all routes worked.

1. What was the issue you faced in NGINX?
 -The issue occurred because the frontend was a Single Page Application, but NGINX was trying to serve client-side routes like /dashboard as real files.
 - Since they didn’t exist, NGINX returned 404.
 - This happened because the SPA fallback rule (try_files $uri /index.html) was not applied correctly


2. What is an SPA and why does it need special NGINX configuration?
  - SPA stands for Single Page Application.
  - Only one HTML file exists (index.html) and all routing happens in the browser using JavaScript.
  - So when a user directly loads /dashboard, the server must return index.html, not a file.
  - NGINX needs a fallback rule to handle this.


3. How did you identify the problem?
   - I checked the NGINX logs and saw errors like:
   - open() "/usr/share/nginx/html/dashboard" failed
   - That made it clear NGINX was treating SPA routes as real files instead of falling back to index.html.

4. How did you fix it?
   - I fixed it by restructuring the NGINX server block:
   - Only one location / block
   - Added proper SPA routing:
     try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;

Ensured static assets were served correctly

Cleaned up proxy fallback logic
After this, all routes loaded correctly.


5. Why does try_files matter for SPAs?
   - try_files checks if a file exists.
   - If it doesn’t, NGINX sends index.html, allowing the SPA router to take over.
   - Without it, NGINX returns a 404 for any client-side route.
